description: Refresh a Rollstack slide deck with new data, such as this month's numbers or a newer version of a file, and fix the slides the new data made wrong yourself, with the Rollstack MCP tools replaceDataset, startReportRun, getReportSlideImages and saveReportSlides. Use when the user gives you a newer file for a deck, or wants you to roll a deck forward and fix its slides. To refresh a deck from its sources and let Rollstack repair its slides, or to schedule its updates, use rollstack-refresh-and-schedule instead.

# Rollstack update deck

Rollstack's MCP server hands out the guide to updating a deck, so the guide always matches the tools. This skill only tells you where to start.

1. Find the report with `listReports`. It must be a slide deck (type `SlideDeck`): for another type, `startReportRun` refreshes its syncs and there are no slides to fix.
2. Call `getReportDesign` for the report, without `layoutIds`, and follow "Updating a deck after its data changed" in its guide.
3. In short: when the user gives you a newer file, find the uploaded file each datasheet reads by its `datasetId` in `listReportDatasheets`, and replace it in the same columns. With a shell, send the new file, a CSV or a workbook, with `createDatasetUpload` and that `datasetId`; without one, write a CSV into `replaceDataset`. Only the user who uploaded a file may replace it. Data read from a dashboard or a spreadsheet needs no replacing: the run reads it again.
4. Run the report with `startReportRun` and `repairSlides: false`, wait for it with `getReportRun`, then look at every slide with `getReportSlideImages`.
5. Fix only what no longer fits or no longer reads true, such as a title whose claim the new numbers contradict. Check each figure you rewrite with `queryReportData`.
6. Tell the user which slides you changed, and show them with `showReport`.
