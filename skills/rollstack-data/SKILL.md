# Rollstack data

Rollstack's MCP server hands out the guide to getting data in and shaping it, so the guide always matches the tools. This skill only tells you where to start.

1. Call `getReportDataGuide` once, before anything else. Read it and follow it.
2. In short: send the file with `createDatasetUpload` when you have a shell, read a workbook's sheets with `getDataset` and add the range that starts at its header row, then add the file to the report with `addReportDatasheets` and use the datasheet ids it answers.
3. Check every figure you will claim with `queryReportData`, and shape data a chart needs with `previewReportDatasheetChanges` until it answers `valid: true`. Save it with `saveReportDatasheetChanges` before you save the slides that show it.
4. To write the slides themselves, follow the `rollstack-slides` skill.

When `getReportDataGuide` is not among Rollstack's tools, they are not on for the user yet: upload a CSV with `createDataset`, add it with `addReportDatasheets` and pass the datasheet ids to the slides agent with `sendReportMessage`.
